# Repository Description for CSV Reading and Naive Bayes Classifier

## Overview

This repository features Python code for efficiently reading CSV files and implementing a Naive Bayes classifier. It's designed for users interested in data handling, probability theory, and machine learning basics. The code is split into distinct functions for ease of understanding and adaptability.

## Key Features

1. **CSV File Reading**: Utilizing Python's `csv` module, the `readCSVFile` function demonstrates efficient data extraction from CSV files into a list format.

2. **DataFrame Conversion**: The `list_to_dataframe` function showcases transforming lists into Pandas DataFrames, offering a more structured approach for data analysis.

3. **Conditional Probability Calculation**: The `calculate_conditional_probabilities` function focuses on computing essential probabilities for the Naive Bayes classifier, integrating statistical concepts with Pandas data handling.

4. **Naive Bayes Classifier Implementation**: The `naive_bayes_classifier` function applies the Naive Bayes algorithm for classification, predicting missing data fields based on calculated probabilities.

## Usage

The code includes an example of reading data from `training_data.csv`, converting it into a DataFrame, and applying the Naive Bayes classifier for prediction tasks. It's a practical demonstration for managing missing values and categorizing incomplete records.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas library

## Applications

The repository suits various applications in data analysis, predictive modeling, and educational purposes for understanding Naive Bayes classifiers.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository, install Pandas, and run the example to see the classifier in action. The code is well-commented for easy modification and experimentation.
